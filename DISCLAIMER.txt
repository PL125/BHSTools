While I have done my best to ensure this software is safe and functions as intended, it is provided AS IS. This software is neither supported nor endorsed by Brinks, ADT, Honeywell, IntelliSense, or any other third party, and was produced through reverse engineering. If you decide to use it on your hardware, you do so at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage this software causes, including but not limited to malfunctioning or inoperative equipment, and any loss of life, limb, or property that may result from such malfunctions.

Also, please do not use my software on any equipment unless you own it, or otherwise have authorization from the owner, and make sure the owner is aware of the above disclaimer before proceeding. My intention is to make it possible to program one's own security equipment without hard-to-find hardware, as well as share technical discoveries about Brinks security equipment. My intention is NOT to aid in unauthorized tampering with security equipment.

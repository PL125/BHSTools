## How to program your panel

You're probably here because you want to program your Brinks system and don't have the special device the technicians use. Not a problem; with Soft3121, all you need is an easy-to-obtain RS-485 or UART interface, and you can program your panel with your PC.

**If you are using RS-485, make sure the adapter is the kind with two or three terminals. Some have more than that; I am not sure if this kind will work.**

### Using RS-485

If you look at your alarm's main panel, you will see several screw terminals with wires in them. Two of them should be labeled "DATA" and "CLK". This is the IntelliBus port, to which keypads and other peripheral devices are wired.

You may also notice a small connector (labeled "J3") with four pins. This provides the same exact connection; the rightmost pin (looking at it with the screw terminals below the connector) is DATA, and the one immediately to the left of it is CLK. This is the programming port, for connecting the official programming device.

You will need to wire your RS-485 adapter to the panel, with the "A" terminal going to DATA, and the "B" terminal going to CLK. If your adapter's terminals are not labeled A and B, just guess which one goes to which; guessing wrong won't do any damage. If your adapter has three terminals instead of two, ignore the "GND" one, or optionally you can connect it to one of the "-" terminals on the panel, which I guess is recommended if you plan on leaving it attached permanently.

Now, it's easiest to wire it to the screw terminals, as you can use regular wire for that. However, if you have the right kind of connector, attaching it to the programming port will avoid the need to loosen the screws, so there's no risk of other wires falling out.

Once you have it wired, plug the adapter into your computer. You'll probably want to use a laptop for this, though something like a Raspberry Pi is ideal if you want something you can conveniently leave connected to the panel to access over a network. You'll need to determine what serial port the adapter appears as—if you're using Windows, it will most likely be COM3, though you may need to install a driver before it will work. Look in Device Manager to be sure. If you're on Linux, run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`; if you just plugged in the adapter, it's probably the highest-numbered one.

### Using the UART port

Another option is to use the factory programming port, labeled "J8". This provides a direct connection to the serial port on the panel's CPU. (More specifically, the "ASC0" port, for anyone familiar with the C161 series.) This port has five pins, with a gap between two of them. The pinout is as follows:

    [ 1 2 3 4   6 ]

	1: P0L.4 (used for bootloader access)
	2: TX (panel out, PC in) (MISO on Bus Pirate)
	3: RX (panel in, PC out) (MOSI on Bus Pirate)
	4: GND
	6: Like AUX, but always active (not needed here)

If you are using a [Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate), the following sequence of serial terminal commands will configure it properly:

	b 7
	     (set terminal to 38400 baud and press Space as prompted)
    m 3 7 1 1 1 1
	(1)
	     (type 'y' when prompted)

#### BSL Mode

If all you need to do is program your panel in the traditional sense (as an installer would) then you can ignore this section. However, for all the hackers among you who are interested in experimenting with your system at a lower level, the UART port has another trick. If you ground pin 1 (P0L.4) while powering up the panel, you will activate BSL (Bootstrap Loader) mode. Instead of booting its firmware like usual, the panel will attempt to boot via the UART port.

In case it isn't obvious, this means you can boot whatever code you want on your panel.

In the `bsl` directory, you will find a script called `romdump.py`. If you have a panel in BSL mode connected via UART, you can use this script to back up the contents of its firmware to your PC. You can then use `flash.py` to restore this backup if the need arises—say, if your panel is bricked by corrupted programming. Since the firmware is not needed to run the bootstrap loader, this will work even if your panel's EEPROM is completely blank.

For more information about the bootstrap loader, see the [Infineon C161PI user manual](http://www.keil.com/dd/docs/datashts/infineon/c161pi_um.pdf), "The Bootstrap Loader", page 273.

### Next steps

Run `s3121.py`, giving the serial port as an argument. For example, `./s3121.py /dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux) or `s3121.py COM3` (Windows), though your command may be different.

Next, open a Web browser and point it to http://127.0.0.1:3121. If you're doing this remotely, such as over SSH to a Raspberry Pi, substitute that device's IP address. **Warning: By default, this software is currently configured to listen on all network interfaces; this means anyone on your network will be able to access your system's programming. If this is a problem, edit `s3121.py` and replace `0.0.0.0` with `127.0.0.1`, though this will make it impossible for you to access it from another device on the network as well.**

If all goes well, a Web page will load with an interface resembling the official programming device, and of course it should function like said device as well.
